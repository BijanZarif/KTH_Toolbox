@brief Toolbox for Nek5000

@details 
This directory contains number of tools used by toolboxes developed at KTH. 
Files are grouped by taks and placed in a tree structure, where the parent directories (modules) 
perform some operations and can define tasks and interfaces that have to be provided by their 
subdirectories (submodules). This structure can be repeated recursively with submodules becoming
parent modules for nex level structures. The top level directories are related to the main services 
that have to be provided for toolboxes. Examplary framework structure is presented in a figure.

Dependences between modules are described in FRAMEWORK.txt (present in every directory) including:
- documentation section witten in a form of doxygen C comment
- list of existing submodules (subdirectories)
- list of conflicting submodules
- default submodule
- list of required modules (from other tree branches)
- list of required conflicting submodules (from local subdirectories)

Modules can provide tools, [runtime parameters] (@ref parameter_list_page), memory structures (common blocks), 
define interfaces and perform some tasks.
The main goal is to simplify development of toolboxes by defining simple tasks that could be used by number of tools. 
At the same time clear difinition of the inteface alows to keep number of different implementation of the same task.
